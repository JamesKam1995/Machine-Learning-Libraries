# Machine-Learning-Libraries
I create this repo so that to record my learning. I will try to implement those algorithm from scratch in python by using numpy and standard python libraries. <br>

Welcome anyone to comments and add on features to those algorithm <br>

Current Algorithm in waitlist: <br>
- SVM
- Linear Classifier
- Neural Network
- CNN
- RNN
