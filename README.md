# Machine-Learning-Libraries
Those who can't implement algorithm from scratch probably cannot understand it. I create this repo so that i can implement algorithms based on my understanding. Welcome anyone to comments and add on features to those algorithm 

Current waitlist:
KNN
SVM
Linear Classifier
Decision Tree
Neural Network
CNN
LSTM
Transformer
