# Machine-Learning-Libraries
Those who can't implement algorithm from scratch probably don't really understand it. <br>

I create this repo so that to record my learning. I will implement those algorithm from scratch in python by using numpy and standard python libraries. <br>

Welcome anyone to comments and add on features to those algorithm <br>

Current Algorithm in waitlist: <br>
- Linear Regression
- KNN
- SVM
- Linear Classifier
- Decision Tree
- Neural Network
- CNN
- LSTM
- Transformer
